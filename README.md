My Website
==================================

Hi, I am Malhar Jajoo.

I grew up in India/Oman and did most of my high school at Indian School Muscat (ISM), Oman under the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) curriculum. In High school I had a keen interest in Mathematics and Chemistry and would frequently participate in Olympiads. These activities gradually led to an increased interest in Engineering and I began pursuing a Masters of Engineering (MEng) degree at Imperial College London after completing my high school. After 4 long years, I am now an Electronics and Information Engineering (EIE) graduate from Imperial College London.

My EIE degree curriculum was a mix of hardware and software subjects ( although inclined more towards software ) and I thoroughly enjoyed my time ( though fairly challenging 4 years! ) at Imperial. If I were to pick a favourite subject, it would be Robotics, as I really enjoyed related subjects that I learnt in my 3rd and 4th year. I have a high level of interest in Algorithms and DS, the closest thing that fundementally resembles Mathematics in Computing, according to me.


This website has been made for a few purposes:

- To display the projects that I have undertaken in my leisure time or as part of
  degree curriculum at Imperial College London.
  
- To save and present my work in a coherent manner.
