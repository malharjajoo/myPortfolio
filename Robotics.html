												<h3>Overview</h3>
												<p>
												    This robot was made as part of the Robotics course at Imperial College London in the Autumn Term, 2016. The team consisted of 4 members which was just the appropriate number of people for effective communication and work. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p> 
                                                    The end goal of the project was to create a Robot that could navigate accurately in a given and known map ( Localisation only ) with a single sonar sensor for sensing the depth of surrounding objects/walls. The final task also consisted of accurately finding and bumping into 3 obstacles which could be placed anywhere in the given map.

                                            <section>
                                                <p>
												    The course was divided into several milestones which have been explained in detail below in a chronological order.
                                                    There is also a video of one of the final 
                                                    test runs before the challenge !

												<h3>Task 1- Tuning PID Control for Odometry</h3>
												<p>
												    The first task was to tune the PID control and calibrate the robotics for Odometry.Odometry refers to calibrating the distance travelled by a robot based on internal sensors ( like a Rotary encoder).
                                                    
                                                    This was a little tricky as it involved several parameters that we were required to tune.
                                                    
                                                    In order to test this, the first task was to calibrate the robot to trace a Square region of 10 cm sides , a total of 10 times, on a sheet of paper, and return back to the start postion.
												</p>
												
                                                <p> A complete specification of this task can be seen <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/Robotics/RoboticsResources/questions1.pdf">here.</a></p>

                                             <section>
												<h3>Task 2 - Forward/Backward Proportional Servoing with Touch and Sonar Sensor</h3>
												<p>
												    The second task was simple and involved using the sonar to detect obstacles and try to avoid it by moving away ( forward or backward ) from a potentially moving obstacle.If the robot hit an obstacle , the touch sensor was used to detect it.
                                                  
                                                    
                                                    In order to test this, the second task was to follow a wall in the lab room.

												<h3>Task 3 & 4 - Way point Navigation and Monte Carlo Localization ( MCL )</h3>
                                                  
                                                <p>
                                                  These two tasks were the most crucial in  learning about how Probablistic Robots navigated accurately in a given map.
                                                </p>
                                                  
                                                <h5> task 3 - Way point navigation </h5>
                                                <p>
                                                    This involved represnting the particles ,the coordinate system,walls in the map and the angle of the robot with the horizontal axis. 
                                                    
                                                    In order to test this, the task was to follow a wall in the lab room.

                                                  <h5>Task 4 - MCL </h5> 
												<p>
												
                                                    MCL uses a particle filter to accept/reject particles that don't represent the current position ( as a pair of coordinates ) of the robot accurately.
                                                     The complex maths was involved in representing Sonar Likelihood and using the probability value for a Update ( accepting/rejecting) particles.
                                                 </p>

												<h3>Task 5 - Final Task</h3>
												<p>
												    The final task was simply to find 3 obstacles placed in the map.It involved using the sonar to detect walls and obstacles (which were bottles for this task) 
                                                     and them bump into the bottles and then return back to the starting position in a certain time limit to gain maximum points.

												<h3>Conclusion ...</h3>
												<p>
													Enjoyed the course/project as it was my first robotics course and the tasks were very well organized , thanks to Mr.Andrew Davison for that,fit right into the schedule and at the same time challenging upto the level of a very basic introductory course to Probablistic robotics. It also taught me to work in a team and use version control software Git.
